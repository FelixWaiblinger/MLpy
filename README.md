# MLpy

This is a personal, beginner-friendly machine learning library written in
    Python.

The goals of this project are a deep and throughout understanding of common
    algorithms and techniques used in supervised, unsupervised and
    reinforcement learning with as little dependencies as possible.

The project is work-in-progress and still ongoing, so there are bugs and
    missing features to be expected.
